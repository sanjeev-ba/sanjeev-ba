## Hi there 😄

My name is Sanjeev and I'm a software developer.

👨‍💻 I've created a few apps. 

   * An iOS app [Shopping-List](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/shopping-list/id6740161341?l=en-GB) to create and maintain your grocery items.
     
   * [Ambient Weather](https://sanjeev-ba.github.io/ambient-weather/), a webapp to display the weather in an ambient way.

   * Or to have just fun: [Memory](https://sanjeev-ba.github.io/memory-app/).

Feel free to try them out 🙂.

📧 If you have any questions, please [contact me](https://sanjeev-ba.github.io/contact-page/).
